Doxygen theme to style HTML output similar to Github Markdown
=============================================================

This is a quick and dirty hack so that the Doxygen HTML output resembles Github
Markdown pages with a tree view navigator on the left. I am an HTML and CSS
novice and any fixes or improvements are most welcome!

this Doxygen CSS theme.

WARNING! This theme has been tested and works with Doxygen 1.8.14. CSS changes
have been made in later releases and it broke the theme. Please share if you
have fixed it ;)

Enjoy!
